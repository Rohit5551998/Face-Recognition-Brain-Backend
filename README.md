# Face-Recognition-Brain-Backend

This repo was separated from the original repo which included both frontend and backend code.<br />
Now the Frontend of the App can be found at repo [Face-Recognition-Brain](https://github.com/Rohit5551998/Face-Recognition-Brain).<br />
The code from this repo is hosted [here](https://face-recognition-nodejs-backend-production.up.railway.app/).<br />

**_NOTE:_**  The application was previously deployed to Heroku but due to the Free Tier shutting down it was moved to Railway. Due to Railway App restrictions the deployed application will only be available for the first 20-21 days of the month.
